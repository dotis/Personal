### Notes from Mtg. on 2/14/2023
1. Lots of folks: FGBNMS, ECU, Auburn (K. Dunning, R. Asch)
2. Dillon Amaya: Marine heatwaves; need to standardize baselines; poor communication practices within the community.
  a. Normal is some fixed period in the past (fixed baseline)
  b. Or, use a shifted baseline where now 1990-2020 (30 year baseline).
3. Miscommunication occurs depending on which baseline method is used.
4. Working group is writing a paper to clairfy this issue.
5. Josh K.- How do we choose a method? Can they be blended?
6. Use the metric you want, but describe using precise terminology "heat stress" vs. "heatwave"
7. Three categories: long-term warming, heatwaves (extremes) above a shifted baseline, then look at them together ("total heat exposure", "heat stress" or other?)
8. From MTK: Apologies--  poor typing pre-coffee. Will there be a mechanistic typology associated-- e.g. whether a marine warming is caused by changes in  local atmospheric or circulation,  in your discussion? This may be more relevant/easy in hindcast.
9. From Zac C. (via Frank): Zac Cannizzo gave this example of a possible confusing statement: (e.g. "the heat stress (anomaly) resulted in increased heat stress (physiology) in the target organism"). Further, "heat stress" in an organism is often a threshold that can be defined physiologically. This could potentially lead to further confusions of terminology (e.g. "while a heat stress (anomaly) occurred, it did not trigger heat stress (physiology) in the target organism").
10. Josh K: Do we need to separate this? A more holistic approach? A "heat system". If we take this a single system, can we see other synergies and effects when we combine the long term trends and extreme events.
