GEE code for S5P ALH
collection: 'COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_AER_LH'
Many images w/no data. How to find good images?

S5P Record begins in July 2018
Data looks good for June 2020 
Data only visible with high enough AOD
Layer height starts around 2200m off Africa, then drops to ~800m by Puerto Rico

Paper:
1. Look at VIIRS DT AOD time-series (define "events) since S5P started
2. Look at weekly ALH composites in summer-fall (look at southern fork as well)
3. Compare event times, durations
4. Look at CALIPSO for a set of well-defined events
