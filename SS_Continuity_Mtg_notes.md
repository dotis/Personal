## Seascape Continuity Project meeting notes

### 10/6/2022

Attendance: FMK, MTK, JT, DO

New scope of work - What items were removed?

Hypotheses:

Downscaling

VIIRS vs. MODIS

Oceanographic - Is there a predicable phenology or are things changing over time?

Joaquin - VIIRS/OLCI SS prods ready soon for comparison (next week monthly, then 8-day after that)

Will have 6 years of comparable data

How to compare MODIS to VIIRS/OLCI

Use de-orbit data (new) from MODIS

Phenology - 8D or monthly?

How to include OBIS/GBIF?

1. Student (OSU) - phyto/zoos from OBIS compared w/SS - Other in-situ datasets?

Others can look at more localized features - How can we use the global product at a local scale?



OLCI fluorescence - global product uses reflectance

2. Test phenology or other phenomena ( w/VIIRS/OLCI vs. MODIS

Challenges with downscaling - SSS, ADT/SSH not well-resolved (or predictive) at local scale

JT - Use best regional model available

SMOS or other SSS data? - not consistent globally

Or, just a 1-km satellite based SS prods, no models (Europe, East and West US coasts)

How can we demonstrate the utility of SS?

Work with stakeholders to generate case studies. How to engage?

How to get the data, SeascapeR? Joaquin also has a tool. This will fold into MBON Tech WG.

MBON tech needs to loop in MTK for SS details. Dan will be MBON tech. group laison to FMK, MTK

Joaquin, looking at carbon export flux vs. SS
