## L2 PY Workflow
### Tasks
1. FTP L2 files for entire GoM from NASA site (bash script)
 - Three filestreams (OC, SST, SST4/N); Two sensors (MODA, VSNPP) - MODA will go away at some point
2. Mosaic L2 files for ROI (FK, FGB, WFS) - Could use GPT or L2BIN/L3MAPGEN here (xml file for each product and ROI)
3. 7-Day/MO means
