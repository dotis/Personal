## FK WATER QUALITY
## Year 2
1. Generate Sen images
  - Colors added, make comp plot w/1:1 line
  - Make zoomed images, FL, reefs, BB
  - Compare satellite and IS series, but make sure that time intervals match between the two.
  - **FKWQ_stats_analysis_v2021.m**
3. Look at individual bands
4. Look at trends w/depth

Find stations with anomolous IS measurements 
Give to Kelly and Alex
Focus on interesting ones with outliers
Pull sat data (3x3) at IS slope pt. (calculate IS time-interval, then calc sat. slope over that interval)
Make plot of # of years for slope pts.

## Year 3:
Notes from Miami meeting 9/16/22

DEP FKWQ Mtg. 1:30-4
Nick Parr – Has some sonde data – CHL, turb. (tricky – can’t compare land to sonde)

DEP, BNP, FIU will meet QC standards for sonde

Which locations? Where can I find data?

Sondes are 1-m off the bottom (can’t compare to satellite) – Nick runs that program

Follow up on pH, sal, temp from sondes (work w/Alex F.) – no nutrients

Where to find?  - Not going to include sonde data this year

DEP funded programs upload data to WIN, which feeds into SEACAR (this is required and seems to work)

Non-DEP funded – AOML and SERC (funding is now contingent on reporting to WIN)

Is AOML data getting into WIN? – Maybe Chris will start

WIN requires NELAC cert. (not needed for this, so perhaps DST pulls from SEACAR)

AOML just recently became NELAC certified, so old data cannot go into WIN, new data can

DERM (Miami-Dade) is NELAC certified, but not sure if it goes into WIN; goes to a separate site

Most streamlined way is to go directly into WIN, which then goes to SEACAR – DEP preference

Sonde data does not go into WIN

Three outlier programs to reach out to: AOML, DERM (data goes in WIN), SERC

ERDDAP server? – Could host the satellite, sonde and other non-conforming data

Also, could put ALL this data into an ERDDAP server, which could then go into a DST.

Sonde data can go into SEACAR, as can satellite data (images or time-series or both?)

Henry Briceno SERC – Un-filtered CHLa? How is he doing it? Are we apples to apples?

CHLa is important as a canary in the coal mine. Once nutrients get high, it’s too late

DEP wants ALL data into a potential DST

For trend analysis, we need to be much more selective in terms of time periods


### Meeting w/FLDEP on 3/17/23
Joanna, Luke, Tylar, Tori, Dan, Nick, Omar?

ERDDAP server?

What are FLDEP needs here?

Everything in WIN (Joanna)

Who runs WIN? Joanna does not know.

Need a way to query WIN. How? For what params. The idea would be to move data into a DST, dashboard or other tool.

New group forming in DEP (Everglades group) focused on FL Coral Reef (managers). Just met this week. Will assess what are the needs for a DST or other tool. There will be a sub-group here for data needs that will extend into the fall. Question: can we assess change in WQ due to Everglades restoration?

No large changes to protocols, but assessment of sampling gaps.

Can the FKWQ group help organize or co-lead? Luke - Yes, there is a lot of overlap.

Luke - Ready to reach out to individual groups (data providers)

Meetings of specific programs (data providers). Could do over the next couple of months. 

Identify mangement questions in order of priority. What we need to know vs. what we might want to know. Need to prioritize management questions.

Luke: We could layout options for sampling protocols. 

High level overview of how technology can help these efforts. Satellites used to fill gaps? Can sampling methods can be improved?

Luke: Do we need a storymap or other application to present this high level overview?

USF: can we pull data out of WIN? WIN will remain the ingestion portal. Can we use SEACAR to create reports? Is everything in WIN also in SEACAR? 

Luke: Get a technical workshop for data providers.

SEACAR should have a contact. Everything in WIN is also in SEACAR. What are the boundaries? Does it include FL Bay or only DEP managed areas. 

Brian Weinstein. brian.weinstein@floridadep.gov  WIN contact. Get private account.

May need to modify SOW for this year, but need a scope for next year. 

## Future work (Y4)
Tori is the contact here for Y4. Need to draft a SOW.

Support and facilitate this new Everglades Group. What are the technical needs. This may take awhile.

Can Karen Bohnsack be involved as a facilitator? Our group can provide technical support. Data? Visualizations?

FCTCT Florida's Coral Reef Coordination Team

Hybrid/virtual meetings (location would be in Miami)

First meeting in mid-April and then early mid-May. Then need some products for a June full team meeting.

What is the output? A tool to query and interact with the Unified WQ dataset. 

A unified reef map for WQ.

Next meeting of FCTCT team is in June. Need something to show progress. Check a small box. Can we see change in WQ based on restoration efforts? Sort of like a status report.
