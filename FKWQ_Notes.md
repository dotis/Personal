## FK WATER QUALITY
## Year 2
1. Generate Sen images
  - Colors added, make comp plot w/1:1 line
  - Make zoomed images, FL, reefs, BB
  - Compare satellite and IS series, but make sure that time intervals match between the two.
  - **FKWQ_stats_analysis_v2021.m**
3. Look at individual bands
4. Look at trends w/depth

Find stations with anomolous IS measurements 
Give to Kelly and Alex
Focus on interesting ones with outliers
Pull sat data (3x3) at IS slope pt. (calculate IS time-interval, then calc sat. slope over that interval)
Make plot of # of years for slope pts.

## Year 3:
Notes from Miami meeting 9/16/22

DEP FKWQ Mtg. 1:30-4
Nick Parr – Has some sonde data – CHL, turb. (tricky – can’t compare land to sonde)

DEP, BNP, FIU will meet QC standards for sonde

Which locations? Where can I find data?

Sondes are 1-m off the bottom (can’t compare to satellite) – Nick runs that program

Follow up on pH, sal, temp from sondes (work w/Alex F.) – no nutrients

Where to find?  - Not going to include sonde data this year

DEP funded programs upload data to WIN, which feeds into SEACAR (this is required and seems to work)

Non-DEP funded – AOML and SERC (funding is now contingent on reporting to WIN)

Is AOML data getting into WIN? – Maybe Chris will start

WIN requires NELAC cert. (not needed for this, so perhaps DST pulls from SEACAR)

AOML just recently became NELAC certified, so old data cannot go into WIN, new data can

DERM (Miami-Dade) is NELAC certified, but not sure if it goes into WIN; goes to a separate site

Most streamlined way is to go directly into WIN, which then goes to SEACAR – DEP preference

Sonde data does not go into WIN

Three outlier programs to reach out to: AOML, DERM (data goes in WIN), SERC

ERDDAP server? – Could host the satellite, sonde and other non-conforming data

Also, could put ALL this data into an ERDDAP server, which could then go into a DST.

Sonde data can go into SEACAR, as can satellite data (images or time-series or both?)

Henry Briceno SERC – Un-filtered CHLa? How is he doing it? Are we apples to apples?

CHLa is important as a canary in the coal mine. Once nutrients get high, it’s too late

DEP wants ALL data into a potential DST

For trend analysis, we need to be much more selective in terms of time periods
