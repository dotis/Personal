GEE code for S5P ALH
collection: 'COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_AER_LH'
Many images w/no data. How to find good images?

Data looks good for June 2020 
Data only visible with high enough AOD
Layer height starts around 2200m off Africa, then drops to ~800m by Puerto Rico
Need to find good images for that and other events
Compare to CALIPSO
