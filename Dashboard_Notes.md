TODO:
1. Time series
2. Page layout
3. Front matter w/image
4. Navigation (keep it simple for now)
5. Get info from ERDDAP datasets (how to set scale, grab dates)



### Questions for Ben/Tylar
What else is needed to publish?
How to set up github actions?
Why using these GBIF tiles?





What do users want?
1-km ocean color imagery?
climate info?



Ideas:
Climate and other info for each NMS (FGB, FG, GR) - Others?
SST, sea level, air temp, RH, Others?
 - Show long term data w/trends
 - Calculate Sen slope?


How to organize image files? 
By year?
Panels?
How to handle time?
Can a user click on a time series and an image will generate?
 - Probably need shiny
