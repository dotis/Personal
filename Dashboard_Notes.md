## Dashboard v3 Notes


New Version of Dashboards
Using R/Quarto w/RStudio + Github

Boards for now:
1. FKNMS/FGBNMS (images, time series)
2. NOAA CPO Sanctuaries


What do users want?
1-km ocean color imagery?
climate info?



Ideas:
Climate and other info for each NMS (FGB, FG, GR) - Others?
SST, sea level, air temp, RH, Others?
 - Show long term data w/trends
 - Calculate Sen slope?


How to organize image files? 
By year?
Panels?
How to handle time?
Can a user click on a time series and an image will generate?
 - Probably need shiny
