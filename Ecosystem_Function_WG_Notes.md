## Notes for Ecosystem Function WG Mtg. on 3/31/23

1. Nathan Furey (UNH - WG lead)
2. Katrin Iken (AMBON)
3. Abby Benson (USGS/OBIS)
4. Alexis Bahl (UBC) - Southern Ocean Zooplankton
5. Digna Rueda-Roa (USF, remote sensing, in-situ biological data and dissemination)
6. Frank Muller-Karger (USF/MBON lead)
7. Francisco Chavez (CENCOOS MBON lead, eDNA WG)
8. Carolina Peralta (USF; OBIS Caribbean node lead, seagrasses, eDNA)
9. Jorge Brenner (GCOOS director)
10. Dan Otis (USF; RS/SS WG co-lead, find links to RS/SS)

### Linkages to other WG:
1. eDNA (list(s) of species)
2. BioSound (also list(s) of species)
3. Remote Sensing/Seascapes - How can we link functional traits to remote sensing and seascapes?

WG - data/product driven

What MBON data might inform WG goals?

Different MBONs in different habit types. Not easy to work across regions. 

Focus on functional traits. Not focused on species. 

Can we find an MBON dataset that can be standardized to look across nodes/groups?

Alexis - focus on a group, zoos as an example. How do functional traits vary across environments?

Issue - biological datasets are often not standardized. Some information is not always collected (body size). Where is the most usable data?  

Links from Abby - Perhaps this notebook Matt Biddle created would help with understanding where and possibly what MBON data are available in OBIS:

Abby - Traits are not always linked w/the observational data. 

Frank - Functions can be connected to ecosystem services. Are there functions related to human use? 
How do we link traits that we measure w/functions that may be hard to measure? Can we choose a subset of functions?

Alexis (chat) - It also seems eDNA is becoming more popular, especially on cruises, so interpreting the use of this data would be helpful.

Jorge - Identify a management need and then focus on an ecosystem level function where we can link to ecosystem services.

Katrin - There is a lot of interest in eDNA and we could use that as part of this group.

Nathan - Can we compare traditional abundance measurements w/eDNA. What are the sites, datasets and taxa that we can use here?

Abby (chat): The only hiccup I see with eDNA for MBON is that the data are not really currently shared in an openly accessible way except for one dataset from Francisco's MBON / CeNCOOS.

Frank - Can we track a trait or community function w/eDNA? Where are w/eDNA? What info can we extract?

Francisco - Need eRNA (coming along) to look at gene expression.

Nathan - We need to push to get these data online in standardized formats, but we need to engage our current users. This is not a data scraping exercise.

Can we find focused datasets that we can use now?

Abby - We may want to use data that is already shared. That will help us encourage sharing in the future.
