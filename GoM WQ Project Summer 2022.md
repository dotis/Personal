## Summer 2022 Gulf of Mexico Water Quality project 
### Daniel Otis, Vivian Cargille

## Goals: 

1. Find and perform quality control on in-situ water quality measurements from the GoM.

Filter by: length, currently sampled?, bathymetry, 


## In situ water quality data
FK: Merged dataset from AOML, which includes AOML, SERC, DERM, DEPECA, BC datasets

In-situ products: Chlorophyll-a, SST (Temp.), Turbidity, CDOM absorption(?)


## Satellite data:

Use 1-km MODIS-Aqua monthly composites over entire GoM (01/01/2003-12/31/2021 - 19 years (228 months) total) 

Sat. Products: Chlorophyll-a, SST, Rrs667, aCDOM_443

Compare two filestreams: L3 1-km processed at USF and L3 4-km monthly data from OB-DAAC

## MATLAB Code to look at FKWQ data

Needed files: FKWQ_merged_CHLa.mat, FKWQ_merged_Turb.mat, FKWQ_Locations.mat, TurbSlopes.mat, ChlaSlopes.mat, Chla_stack.mat
