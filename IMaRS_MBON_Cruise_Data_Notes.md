### Notes on IMaRS data protocols

Ian Smith and Enrique Montes want to have a common approach to data inventory

How to boil down data into common "Master Speadsheet"?

What is the best format for this? Can we make a master list that can be queried?

Duplicate CDOM samples on recent cruises. We need to compare, but then AOML can run them going forward. When can we turn over to them.

HPLC data: submitting forms: calibration files, cruise logs, other PDFs, comments (who processed?, COV between samples), some header names have changed.

Sabastian: script to generate headers for SeaBASS sebastian. R Code?




Tasks:
1. Process and compare CDOM between AOML and USF. CDOM can then be done by AOML.
2. AOML needs a way to archive and serve spectral data.
4. Rrs data - can we compare above water Rrs with the two instruments? - Magnitudes are different, but Rrs seems comperable. Is this a unit issue?
 - IMaRS can stop doing scans, leave it to AOML with a new sensor.
 - Dave English can compare the two instruments before next cruise (R/V Hogarth leaving from St. Pete)
5. Need to coordinate data protocols with Ian and Enrique at AOML.
