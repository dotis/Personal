## NOAA Climate project
### Climate data meeting 8/8/2022
### Where to get best data to build indicators?

What are the indicators?

How are climate data accessed? Are there best practices?

NCEI is a good source. Land-based stations and satellites

Indeces? - How to define for oceans

Need to find thresholds first (definition of a "dry" or "wet" day

Look at WMO data and CLIVAR

How to define baseline and trends?

Variables"

Sea-level

Air Temperature

RH

Water Temperature

Winds

MLD? - Or model output from ECCO-2?

EPOCH (1961-1990) ; 1981-2010
Epochs are updated every ten years; new "normal" is defined w/20 year overlap

How to define marine heatwaves?

List of marine sanctuaries w/locations - How to define our "areas"?
