#### Ideas for Bio-Indicators WG

1. Can we make a "Biodiverssity Scorecard" for each MBON region, or any AOI?
2. This would include:
   - What are the most important species/group?
   - Are there particularly important commercial species, keystone species or other species that can act as a bellweather for the system?
   - Is there enough data about these species to properly assess the state of the system?
   - How are these species/goups doing? Can we describe status and trends?
   - Alternatively, we could focus on trophic level
   - Can we identify trends in BD indeces like richness?
   - Can we come up with an index to describe the state of the system?
   - This would be based on a series of metrics:
   - Can we fold in environmental data or demographic trends (SST - warming; SLR; Tourism; Fishing/Development pressures; others)
   -
