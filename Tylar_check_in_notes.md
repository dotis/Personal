1. Time series for DBs? The .csv files are now on /srv/imars-objects/tpa_pgs/rois/gom/EXT_TS_MODA/OC
We created a new directory for the csv output:


3. Where should these files end up? dune? public_html?, other? - They will go to GH and then be picked up by airflow.
4. FKNMS board still not updating - fixed, try later

5. Climate board: Remove CRW product, add other products (SLR, pH), how to structure tabs?, can we create a climatology tab/section? 
   - Did not get to this today.
