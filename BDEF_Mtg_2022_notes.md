### BDEF Meeting Notes 2022

FaCeT - Climate ready fisheries - Rebecca Lewison

Marine Heatwaves

Could SS be incorporated?

GOES-16 (SST every ~15min, 2km) - Can grab from Coastwatch

Thermal sharpening? - Analagous to pan-sharpening

EMIT - on ISS (hyperspectral radiometer - meant to look at dust)

MarineVERSE - Sam Purkis (UM); habitat mapping, biodiversity obs. Are these going into OBIS?

Franz Mueter - AMBON, UA Fairbanks. Working with SS, has not has good results. Very uniform. Downscaled products do no match 5-km SS well.

Book  "Scale" by Geoffrey West - allometric scaling theory

Chris Hurley at UBC - Temp loggers, other info from Salish Sea/BC region

Patrick Keys - WAM-2 layers Github for Merra-2 reanalysis

Bryan Pijanowski - Soundscapes in many biomes (including aqautic), ECOSTRESS data in Bangladesh

Catherine Mitchell - Bigelow, looking at zooplankton (calanus) w/OC

Woody/Keith wrap up:

ESO program (synthesized new missions)

NISAR - radar, 30m, high data volumes

GLIMR - 300m, US East/West coasts (thermal?)

NASA SBG, then ESA CHIME, 30m VSWIR through thermal

AOS - atmospheric sensor - 2 satellites

MC - gravity/deep water, next gen. GRACE

Next meeting - May 8-12; combined meeting

New solicitations:

Ecological Forecasting - two calls

A.51 Applications-oriented Augmentation for Research and Analysis
Open call through 3/19, 2023
Related to Applications Guidebook

Keith looking for undergraduate interns - maybe poll my ChemII students?

Go to NASA interns page - look at the BEF section
